Blockchain learning material and resources for friends and family.

## Introduction

First of all, don't get frustrated if you don't understand some concepts the first, 
second or third time you read them, some topics took me several attempts to understand, 
some others I haven't completely grasped what they're all about and still, I'm effectively
building products around them. This is a journey full of new knowledge about an exciting, 
revolutionary piece of tech. _Learn, build, and repeat_. Also, don't forget to enjoy the ride.

## Background knowledge

How comfortable are you with the following concepts?
+ **Proof of work:** It is an _incentive mechanism_ as well as a _consensus protocol_ 
where nodes work in unison to solve a globally distributed cryptographic challenge.
> It is computationally intensive and also guarantees that any solution or proof
> is genuine and that the solver can prove that they indeed solve the challenge
> so that they can receive the reward.
+ **Cryptography:**

Some resources for amping up your core blockchain concepts:

## Blockchain. What is it?

Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto, year of creation, impact in world's financial systems.

### What gives cryptocurrencies their value?

Lets imagine you wake up to a world where economy has collapsed overnight, 
banks and every trustworthy finantial institution has dissapeared. How will you be able to 
buy a morning espresso from your local coffee shop? 

Well, there are a couple of different possible answers to that, you may be able to give
something in exchange for that fresh cup of coffee, but what if there are
ten people behind you expecting to trade some goods as well. Eventually, the coffee shop owner
will run out of space for storing those items or will cover all their immediate needs, it is not scalable.
You will also run with some problems regarding valuation and matching of trading assets. You may expect
a hot beverage will cost you about 30 pickles, but coffee shop personnel may value it closer to 50
pickles, or maybe they believe there aren't enough pickles in the world that can buy you an espresso
because they are asking for doritos' bags instead.

Suddenly, you come up with this great idea, living the digitally enhanced life you live it only makes sense
for you to try to trade one of your precious digital assets, and you pay with your recently aquired PDF of a teen vampire 
best seller novel, you email it to the coffee shop and wait still in front of the line, grinning from ear to ear and 
dreaming about that morning elixir you're about to get ‚òïÔ∏è. What do you think the cashier will tell you? Will they just accept 
it and provide you with your desired product? Most certainly not! How many people you think owns a copy of that PDF book? 
If everyone's aware it is a best seller, and probably, a lot of copies circulate out there, demand for that particular 
file decreases, price goes down to the point that it's worth nothing.

This lead us to some fundamental problems when using digital assets as means for storing value: 
+ **Infinite production:** Zero cost for producing an asset allows plenty of assets to exist and circulate,
meaning, there's no real value in something that everyone can potentially own for free.
+ **Double spend:** The same digital asset can be sent to multiple parties, two unaware people could be receiving
the same picture of your dog üê∂ in exchange for a product or service.

In order to solve this problem,
